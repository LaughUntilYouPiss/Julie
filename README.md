# Julie - Insurance Callbot
### GenAI Hackathon Project – Capgemini Morocco

## 🔍 Abstract

Insurance call centers handle a high volume of repetitive, low-complexity customer requests, leading to long waiting times and operational overload.
This project presents an **AI-powered insurance callbot** that leverages **Generative AI, Agentic AI and NLP pipelines** to autonomously handle common customer inquiries, improving efficiency, responsiveness, and customer satisfaction.



## 🎯 Problem Statement

Insurance support teams receive thousands of daily calls related to:

* claim follow-ups
* contract and policy information
* frequently asked questions

These repetitive interactions result in:

* long customer wait times
* agent overload
* increased operational costs

➡️ **The challenge:** automate these requests while maintaining accuracy, clarity, and user trust.



## 🚀 Proposed Solution

We developed an **intelligent conversational callbot** capable of:

* understanding natural language queries
* identifying user intent
* extracting key entities and context
* interacting with internal business tools
* generating accurate, contextual responses

The system is designed to handle the majority of first-level customer interactions autonomously, escalating only complex cases to human agents.



## 🧠 System Architecture (High-Level)

1. User message ingestion (text or transcribed call input)  
2. Intent classification & entity extraction  
3. **Context retrieval via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Semantic search over a vector database (Chroma)  
   - Retrieval of relevant policy documents, FAQs, and knowledge base entries  
4. **Business data access & database querying**  
   - Structured queries to retrieve customer-specific or contract-related information  
5. Reasoning and response generation using Large Language Models (LLMs)  
6. Structured and contextual response delivery to the user  



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
* **LangChain**
* **LangGraph**
* **Multilingual Embeddings**
* **Chroma Vector Database**
